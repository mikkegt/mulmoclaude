// POST /api/mcp/broker-ready — the mulmoclaude MCP broker reporting that it
// answered `initialize`, with how long it took to get there.
//
// Why: the broker is a grandchild of this server. Claude CLI spawns it over
// stdio and owns its stderr, so its `[mcp-server] …` lines never reach
// `server/system/logs/`. From the host, a broker that is slow and a broker that
// is dead look identical — that ambiguity is what #2842 was filed against, and
// what made a `tsx`-path install read as "the connect-wait gate is too small".
//
// The timings are measured INSIDE the broker, relative to its own process
// start, so no host/container clock agreement is needed — and the cold boot we
// care about (tsx transcoding the import graph, or node reading the 6 MB
// bundle) happens after that process starts, so it lands inside the number.
//
// Body: { bootMs: number; initializeMs: number; kind: "bundle" | "tsx" }
// Query: ?session=<chat session id>, as every broker bridge call carries.
// Authentication: bearer, same as the rest of /api.
