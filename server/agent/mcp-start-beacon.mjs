// The first thing the MCP broker process does (#2842).
//
// Loaded with `--import`, so node evaluates it BEFORE the broker's own entry —
// before tsx transcodes the 292-file import graph, and before node reads the
// 6 MB bundle. That ordering is the point: it turns "the process exists" into
// something the host can see, separately from "the process finished booting",
// which the ready beacon reports afterwards. A broker that is merely slow has
// answered this within milliseconds; one that never launched never will, and
// that difference is what lets the host stop waiting on a doomed turn instead
// of sitting out the CLI's full connect timeout.
//
// TWO signals, because the decision they feed KILLS a running turn and they
// fail for unrelated reasons:
//
//   1. A marker file, written synchronously. Measured at 59 ms into a process
//      whose boot went on for another 890 ms.
//   2. An HTTP beacon to the host, retried.
//
// The file is the one that actually beats a slow boot. Node is single
// threaded, and tsx's transcode blocks the event loop, so the fetch below
// cannot complete until the boot it is supposed to precede has finished — on
// the tsx path both beacons reached the host 2 ms apart. The HTTP beacon
// stays because it needs no shared filesystem: it covers the mount being
// unwritable or slow to propagate, where the file covers the network being
// blocked. The host holds off if EITHER arrives.
//
// Import-free apart from node builtins: importing anything of this repo's
// would be loaded before the signal fires, reintroducing the very delay the
// signal exists to precede. That is also why the retry below is written out
// rather than shared with `brokerBeacon.ts`.

/** Create the marker, refusing to write through anything that is already there.
 *
 *  Under Docker this path is inside the workspace bind mount, which the
 *  sandboxed agent can write — so a plain write would follow a symlink planted
 *  at that path and truncate whatever it points at. No privilege is crossed
 *  (the broker runs as the same uid in the same container, so the agent could
 *  write the target itself), but a write that follows an attacker-placed link
 *  is wrong regardless, and the marker never wants to overwrite anything:
 *
 *  - `O_EXCL` — the name carries a fresh per-spawn UUID, so an existing file is
 *    already not ours. Refusing is also what makes a planted one harmless.
 *  - `O_NOFOLLOW` — never traverse a symlink at the final component. POSIX
 *    only; on Windows the constant is absent and falls out of the mask, where
 *    `O_EXCL` alone still refuses a planted entry.
 *
 *  Exported for the unit test; the call below is what runs in the broker. */
