// owns its stderr — so nothing it writes reaches our logs. It POSTs one beacon
// when it answers `initialize`, and this module remembers it for the session.
//
// What that buys: when a turn dies on `handlePermission not found`, the
// recovery log can say whether the broker EVER answered. A broker that is
// merely slow and one that never came up produce identical symptoms otherwise,
// which is exactly the ambiguity #2842 was filed against.
