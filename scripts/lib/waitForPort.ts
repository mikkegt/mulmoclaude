// The wait `yarn dev` performs between "backend spawned" and "start Vite".
//
// It replaces a flat `setTimeout(2000)`, which was a guess that Windows
// routinely lost: a cold `tsx` boot there takes longer, Vite came up first,
// and the page it served was broken in two ways at once (#2975) — every
// `/api` call became a body-less 502 from the proxy, and the auth token the
// dev plugin injects into index.html was read before the server had written
// it, so the tab stayed 401 until a manual reload.
//
// Waiting on the PORT (rather than on a clock, or on `/api/health`) is what
// makes both go away together: `server/index.ts` awaits
// `generateAndWriteToken` before `app.listen`, in one linear async IIFE, so
// "the port accepts a connection" already implies "the token file is on
// disk and current". A health request would prove the same thing and need
// the very credential we are racing.
//
// Everything time- and socket-shaped is injected so the policy is testable
// without either.

 * written on, most of it module loading). So a listener that answers before
 * the first poll interval has elapsed cannot be the process just spawned —
 * it is an older one, and that distinction is the whole point of the wait.
 *
 * It matters because the port alone does not identify who is on it. When
 * `PORT` is implicit and 3001 is busy, `server/index.ts` deliberately walks
 * the NEW backend forward to 3002 while Vite keeps proxying to 3001 (#2650).
 * Both instances share a workspace, so the new one overwrites
 * `.session-token` — and the page then carries a token the backend actually
 * answering on 3001 has never issued, so every request 401s. Reporting that
 * as "ready" would be the readiness check endorsing the exact pairing it
 * exists to prevent.
