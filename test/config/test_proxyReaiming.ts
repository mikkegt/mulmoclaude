// Does a RUNNING Vite proxy actually follow the backend to a new port? (#2995)
//
// The whole fix rests on one property of Vite's bundled http-proxy: each request
// spreads the same object stored as `proxy.options`, so writing
// `proxy.options.target` takes effect from the next request. That is a property
// of a dependency, not of our code — the kind of thing that changes silently on
// an upgrade — so it is pinned here against the real thing rather than argued in
// a comment.
//
// Two backends answer with their own name; the test asks Vite which one it
// reached, before and after the switch. Nothing is mocked: real sockets, a real
// Vite dev server, a real proxy.
