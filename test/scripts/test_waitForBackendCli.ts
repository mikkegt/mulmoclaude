// Integration cover for `scripts/wait-for-backend.ts` — real sockets, a real
// child process, the real CLI (#2981).
//
// The wait FOLLOWS the port the backend published rather than the one `PORT`
// asked for, so what has to be pinned here is the order: learn the port, then
// wait on it. Watching the `PORT`-derived port first is the bug this replaced —
// those two agree only when the request could be honoured, and #2650 is the case
// where it could not.
//
// Every case binds port 0 and reads back the assigned port, so nothing here
// depends on 3001 being free on the runner.

/**
 * Run the CLI while the fake backend publishes its port over and over.
 *
 * A single timed write raced the child's `tsx` boot. The CLI snapshots
 * `.server-port` only once it has booted, and a file that is already there at
 * the snapshot and never rewritten is — by design (#2981) — NOT a publish this
 * run may claim, so a boot slower than the delay left the wait falling back to
 * `PORT` forever. That is the leftover-file contract working, pinned on its own
 * below; it was the fixture that depended on the boot winning a race.
 *
 * Publishing until the child exits removes the dependency without weakening
 * anything: these cases have no `--reset` marker, so the only way they can pass
 * is a write that lands AFTER the snapshot — which is exactly the ordering they
 * exist to prove.
