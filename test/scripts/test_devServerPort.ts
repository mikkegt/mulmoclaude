// Unit tests for the dev proxy's port resolution (#2650).
//
// The backend honours `PORT` while Vite's proxy targeted a literal `localhost:3001`,
// so `PORT=3100 yarn dev` moved only the server — and with a first instance still on
// 3001, the second browser silently rendered the FIRST instance's data.
//
// The rule under test is therefore an EQUIVALENCE, not a validator: for any value,
// the proxy must land on the port the backend binds. So the table below asserts
// against `env.port`'s own coercion (`asInt` + `PORT_RANGE`) rather than against a
// second opinion written here — a stricter parser was the finding Codex raised on
// iter-1, and this is what makes a future divergence fail loudly.
