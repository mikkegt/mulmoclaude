// How a schema-authored `icon` value should be drawn.
//
// `CollectionSchema.icon` / `FeedSummary.icon` / `Shortcut.icon` are free
// strings (`z.string().trim().min(1)` — no format constraint), but the
// Material Symbols font resolves an icon from a LIGATURE: a value the font
// has no ligature for is laid out as ordinary text, which overflows a fixed
// icon box and paints over its neighbours (#2986). So the value has to be
// classified before it reaches the font, not after.
//
// Classifying it also turns emoji from "happens to work" into a supported
// way to tell shortcuts apart without adding a text label (#2960).

/** Every one of the 3896 names in `material-symbols/index.d.ts` matches this
 *  (verified against the shipped list; the charset there is exactly
 *  `[0-9_a-z]`). Note the digits — `123`, `10k`, `3d_rotation` are real icon
 *  names, so a letters-only pattern rejects valid ones.
 *
 *  This says "shaped like a name", NOT "is a name the font carries": a typo
 *  such as `not_a_glyph` passes and still fails to resolve. Bounding what any
 *  value can PAINT is the renderer's job — cutting to one grapheme (below)
 *  bounds the character count, not the rendered width, so both branches are
 *  additionally capped in `plugin-vue/IconGlyph.ts`. */
