// one of those values again. The font resolves an icon from a LIGATURE, so a
// value it has no ligature for is laid out as ordinary text — which overflows
// the fixed icon box and paints over the controls beside it (#2986). Routing
// every surface through `resolveIconGlyph` also makes emoji a supported way to
// tell shortcuts apart without adding a text label (#2960).

// carries no `@vitejs/plugin-vue`, and adding one to render two spans would
// cost more than it buys.

//
// A utility class only exists if some Tailwind build SAW the literal. This
// file is compiled into `@mulmoclaude/core`, and each consumer runs its own
// Tailwind over its own sources: the host's build scans core's dist (verified
// — `bg-lime-50`, declared only in core's `enumColors.ts`, reaches the host
// CSS), but `collection-plugin`'s package build scans only the plugin's own
// src, so a class named solely here is silently absent from its `dist/style.css`.
// A containment rule that evaporates in a packaged consumer leaves exactly the
// overflow this component exists to prevent. An inline style cannot be tree-
// shaken by a scanner and holds for every consumer, present and future.
// (`sizeClass` stays a class precisely because the CALL SITE names it, so the
// caller's own build emits it.)
//
// Widths are measured, not guessed, at font-size 16px:
//   · a resolved ligature — `podcasts`, `rss_feed`, `menu_book`,
//     `3d_rotation` — is EXACTLY 16px (1em);
//   · an unresolved name (`not_a_glyph`) falls back to laying the name out as
//     text: 176px, 11× over;
//   · every emoji tested — `🎙️`, a ZWJ family, a flag, a skin-tone modifier,
//     a tag sequence — is 20px (1.25em), because emoji are drawn wider than
//     the em box.
//
// Hence two different caps. 1em is exact for the icon font and clips only a
// miss. Emoji get 1.25em, which leaves a normal one untouched and bounds the
// case Codex raised on #2988: a cluster whose font lacks the sequence
// decomposes into its parts (a 4-person family → four separate emoji) and is
// otherwise unbounded, even though `resolveIconGlyph` cut it to one grapheme.
